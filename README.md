EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS USING PIMA INDIANS DIABETES DATABASE
## Aim/Purpose
In this project, a dataset with 8 medical predictor variables and 1 target variable was analyzed. To determine whether this dataset is suitable for further modelling and which predictor variables should be considered in the prediction model, we performed an initial inspection of the dataset, including descriptive statistics plots, several classical statistics methods, and exploratory data analysis. 

## Datasource
The dataset can be obtained from R using R code **data(PimaIndiansDiabetes)**. CSV format can be downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database.
